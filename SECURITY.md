# Security Policy
This is a very basic project, and so security issues *should* only be found in the third party software used by this project. 
But nevertheless, if anything is found, feel free to report it here and reports can be forwarded on to dependencies as needed. 

***

## Supported Versions
All my projects use semantic versioning, and anything below v1.0.0 is strictly a POC and not meant for end users or deployment. 
So security issues found in versions under that wont be accepted. (unless found in used third party software where it can be reported) 
| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.0.0    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0     | :x:                |
