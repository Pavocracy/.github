## Feature Requests
To submit a feature request, ensure you use the [feature request template](https://github.com/Pavocracy/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) 

Feel free to request anything you would like, or think should be apart of this project! 
However keep in mind this is a small project and very ambitious features will likely end up in the backlog. 
In saying that, when you request a feature, if you are an experienced programmer please do give some code examples or advice on implementation
for the feature, it will help out a lot!
